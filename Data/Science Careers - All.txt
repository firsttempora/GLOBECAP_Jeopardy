# First category: some terms they might not be familar with
1|100|This is the type of degree you earn from completing a typical four year major at a college or university.  It also refers to a single man.|What is a bachelor's degree?

Unlike other fields (such as the arts), a Ph.D. in a scientific field can be started immediately after finishing an undergraduate program. (In other fields, you need to finish a master's first, but Ph.D.'s are only ~3 years.)
1|500|These two terms, both beginning with "m," describe your primary and secondary field of study at a college.|What are major and minor?|At college, your major is the area you'll get a bachelor's degree in, a minor is like an extra certification added on to your degree.
